A tutorial covering Javascript basics. This repo contains example source code && my solution to
the challenges.

Navigate the directory structure above to see specific course material.

### WIP TODOs

- [ ] split into sections: basics, intermediate, advanced THEME GAMIFIED
- [ ] Git version control
- [ ] Promises and Async / Await
- [ ] Closures, Scope, and Hoisting
- [ ] setTimeout, setInterval
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Javascript event loop - heap, stack, and message queue
- [ ] ES6 classes
    - fields (properties) && methods
    - primitives also have fields and methods! String, Number, Boolean
- [ ] Fetch API
- [ ] HTML and DOM manipulation
    - handle click, hover, keyboard events
    - event listeners (callbacks, baby!)
    - event.preventDefault
- [ ] Regular Expressions
    - GAME: write an email validator
- [ ] Race conditions
- [ ] Express (suuuper quick primer) - "Express Expressed Expressley"

### WIP Games

For each game, add the game itself, and an answer key

- [ ] `variables` - make a mad libs app
- [ ] `conditionals` - make a choose-your-own adventure game
- [ ] `html-dom` - make a counter app - increment with each button press
- [ ] `html-dom` - make an elusive button - button flees mouse position
- [ ] `fetch` - get today's price of bitcoin
- [ ] `localstorage` - save leaderboard high scores
- [ ] `ES6 classes` - make SpaceX class - get rocket launches etc.
- [ ] `express` - make a Movies API using Node / Express
- [ ] `functions` - write a calculator
- [ ] `functions` - use callbacks to iterate through a collection of bitcoin transactions and perform calculations - totals, percent gain, etc.
    - use Array.prototype.map|filter|reduce etc.
    - test iteration/traversal, functions, callbacks
- [ ] `regular-expressions` - use regular expressions and `String.prototype.replace` to find/replace certain words in a short story
- [ ] `regular-expressions` - make an email validator

- Mad Lib App (variables)
- Dogecoin Gains Calculator (functions - teacher: fetch today & 1 month ago - student: implement callback to calculate percentage gain/loss)
- Today's Bitcoin Price (fetch api)
- SpaceX Rocket Launch Schedule (classes - teacher: fetch rocket launches - student: write Launch class with fields and methods)
- Movie Catalogue (node / express - fetch api, JSON responses)
