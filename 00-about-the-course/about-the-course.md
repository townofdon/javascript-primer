# About the Course

Why another Javascript course?

- Most tutorials only cover the bare essentials
- Real-world application - be able to answer "will I ever actually use this?"
- Accumulated nuggets of wisdom from 8+ years in the industry
- Avoid common pain points (learn from my dumb mistakes - FOR FREE!)
- My chance to assimilate others to my coding philosophy:
  - If you can do it right the first time with minimal extra effort, DO IT
  - Clean code saves lives
  - Write maintainable code for other devs (and future-you)
  - Null-check unless you're 120% sure
  - Never trust user input
  - ...and other pearls
