# Meet your Instructor

Don Juan Javier (Townsend) works as a full-time software engineer && mobile/web app developer at Airship LLC,
a fast-growing software start-up in Birmingham, AL.
He loves/hates problem solving (loves when things work, hates when they don't :wink:).

Don's preferred tech stack:

- React
- Next.js
- Rails API
- PostgreSQL
- Firebase (for analytics && push nofitications)

When Don is not crafting halfway intelligible code and building intuitive UIs (most of the time),
you can find him reading Dostoevsky at the local coffee shop, playing his Nord Stage 3 && fighting
bosses in Hollow Knight (_one day I'll beat the final pantheon!!_ :raised_fist:).
