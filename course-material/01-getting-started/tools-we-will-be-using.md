# Tools We Will Be Using

I've tried to keep setup as simple as possible by limiting the number of tools needed to the absolute bare essentials.

More advanced tools may be introduced in later sections, with their own setup guides.

## RunJS

RunJS is a tool to quickly run Javascript on any machine and view the results in a minimalist, easy-to-use interface. No UI, no web output, just raw results of evaluating Javascript statements.

Runs on Mac, Windows, `&&` Linux.

`Get RunJS =>` https://runjs.app/

## Visual Studio Code

We will use this as our text editor.

_"What is a text editor"_, you say? _"Why can't I use Microsoft Word or Notepad"_? Because those are **Rich Text Editors**. Under the hood they actually insert a lot of additional characters that serve as information that word processors use to format the text on the screen. A text editor only concerns itself with editing the raw text, not text presentation.

Visual Studio Code (commonly referred to as "VS Code") is a very popular text editor, and a solid tool for getting started as a Javascript developer. It has a built-in command line, test suite, and makes life easy by allowing extensions to be installed for all sorts of things, like checking your code's syntax in real-time, inserting code snippets, and even auto-prettifying your code for you.

Runs on Mac, Windows, `&&` Linux.

## NodeJS

From the NodeJS docs:

> Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

The primary use-case for NodeJS is writing code that runs on a server. It can be run from the command line.

## nvm

Node Version Manager (nvm) is a tool used to manage multiple versions of node installed on one machine. This is very useful when navigating between projects which may use different versions of node.
